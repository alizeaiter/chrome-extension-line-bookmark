# line-bookmark
A small chrome extension I wished existed so I made it. It basically adds pins on pages with notes and saves them on localStorage to be found later on when revisiting the page. The main reason I made this is because I wanted to easily switch between different lines on a page and not have to scroll back manually and search for them. It does not support pdf files though.
